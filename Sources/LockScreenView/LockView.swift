import SwiftUI
/**
 * A wrapper for `login-screen` (handles background / foreground phase change etc)
 * - Abstract: A view that displays a login screen with options for entering a master password or using biometric authentication
 * - Description: Add `MainView` to this `LockScreenView` (when app goes to background mode, lock-screen covers main-view etc)
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è We keep this in it's own package, so that the autofill extension also can use it, as it can only use code from packages, and not from the app code it self.
 * - Remark: This view is used in the AutoFill-extension and the App
 * - Remark: Initiates session
 * - Remark: Has option to authenticate with `master-password`, `BioAuth` and `pin-code`
 * - Remark: Cover mainview while authenticating user
 * - Note: Has login, overlay, app-content
 * - Note: https://luismdeveloper.com/posts/local-authentication-swiftui/
 * - Note: https://github.com/LuisMDeveloper/local-authentication-swiftUI
 * - Note: We could move it to interface-lib and do authConfig as callback-hocks etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è We should also pass the login-view as a init param, should we? still relevant?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è This wrapper doesn't cover pop-over views, do some research around how to solve that, this research is concluded now, we have LockableView now, or we can do this on the UIWindow level, but wait until we have tested LockableView for macOS and iPadOS etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Replace this with LockableView that supports covering alerts and sheets? that struct uses windows whihch can have sideeffects, yet to be confirmed etc, confirmed
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Move to interfacelib, we need these for the AutoFill extension as well üëà
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Since this uses authConfig which uses auth we should move it to its own repo üëà
use tupleview?
